						<h3>PyCon 2019 in Cleveland</h3>

<p>Alright folks - I’m back from my whirlwind trip to Cleveland, Ohio where I just participated in my very first PyCon event. As an avid fan of open source and a manager of Indeed’s open source program, it was really special to be around so many Python developers. This included some of Python’s core founders and contributors and the foundation that supports them.</p>

<p>Python Software Foundation (PSF) is the primary organization that coordinates efforts in the Python community, and they host PyCon events in cities around the world. This event included 2 days of tutorials, and multiple developer sprints right before and right after the main conference hall lectures and workshops you would expect.</p>

<p>There was a lot to learn. Here’s just some of what I was able to receive.</p>

<img src="img/cleveland.jpg" alt="Cleveland, Ohio" style="width:100%;" />
<p style="font-size:12px; color:#aaa;"><i>Cleveland was a beautifully organized city with great museums and a really walkable downtown.</i></p>

<h2>Learnings from the Python Community</h2>

<h3>Beeware</h3>

<p>Dan Yeuw is working with a team to build an ambitious GUI-application that runs native apps using Python. He explained that he wants to always be able to code 1 app, and then put that app on all his devices. The GUI-widgets that currently exist are usually confusing and are wrapped in C or C++ API’s. BeeWare’s goal is to create apps using “Pythonic code”. The Beeware team is building a set of software libraries and tools to build native mobile applications. Learn more at <a href="https://beeware.org/">https://beeware.org/</a></p>

<h3>Testing in Data Science</h3>

<p>Jes Ford explained the multifaceted aspects of being a Data Scientist and the methods and considerations she must juggle when working with her stakeholders. Her lecture provided concrete examples of how testing plays a role in her work. Jes said, “I’m not a software engineer” - I found this comforting - that you can still be a powerful Python user without considering yourself a full software engineer. Jes explained that her major aim is always to balance getting results to stakeholders as quickly as possible with developing accurate tools that can produce testing results even more quickly.</p>

<p>She also discussed the difficulties of working with legacy code in data science. There’s always code that is developed in different stages, and sometimes what was just exploratory might actually end up in the final release. Jes explained how she’s implemented testing from the earliest stages, so if that code is used in the future then accuracy will already be built-in. For example, the pandas dataframes has built-in methods for testing like duplicated(). It also has a lot of other useful built-in tools for testing, including the one she uses most: assert_frame_equal().</p>

<p style="font-size:12px; color:#aaa;"><i>The Python Software Foundation (PSF) hosts PyCon every year. I found them to be the nicest most approachable community in tech.</i></span>

<h3>A New Era for Python Governance</h3>

<p>Shauna Gordon-McKeon is a python programmer with a background in social psychology, community-building, and governance. She explained that The Python Software Foundation and the Python Language are two distinct groups with two distinct governance communities. The PSF manages the intellectual property of Python and a lot of community building and community management (like conferences). The Python Language team is focused on developing the code of Python. The PSF is a member-elected 501c3 non-profit. The current Board Chair is Naomi Ceder and the next election takes place in June 2019. One specifically interesting part of her talk was learning about the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) including PEP-8: The Style Guide for Python Code.</p>

<p>On a related note, the current Chair of The Python Software Foundation - Naomi Ceder - was floating around the event. I noticed her several times just talking to random groups of people. It was cool to see such a prominent member of the Python Software Foundation casually hanging out. This further solidified my love of the open source community. The Python Software Foundation really spends a lot of time celebrating the community. You should checkout the Community Awards and consider helping out on the Fundraising Campaign.</p>

<h3>Education Summit</h3>

<p>The conference also hosted an Education Summit specifically focused on spreading the learning of Python and empowering the educators that do. One particularly enlightening talk was the Neha Gupta and Jessica Jahnke's Building a Community for Girls with Python helping 5th-12th grade girls build self-confidence through Python education.</p>

<h2>Dev Sprints with Outreachy:</h2>

<p>And finally, one of the best parts of the conference was the four-day dev sprints that the conference hosted after the keynotes and speaking engagements ended. I only stayed for 2 days of the sprints, but got to experience a bit of the action and ended up sitting at the Outreachy table.</p>

<p>Outreachy is a remote internship program that supports diversity in free and open source development. Over 1,000 people apply for around 40 internship spots. The Outreachy sprint was hosted to improve their main Django website by making it work better for applicants, interns, and mentors. I was able to get my environment setup and checked out some of the open issues from the sprint. While I personally had trouble contributing a great deal - had my Django development skills been a bit better - I could have helped tremendously that day. Nonetheless, it was really cool to grab lunch with the other volunteers and learn more about their perspective of Python and open source. If you do want to learn more, you can see all the teams that hosted sprints here: https://us.pycon.org/2019/community/sprints/. If you want to get involved in helping Outreachy, here's how to get started.</p>

<h2>Upcoming events and further information</h2>

<p>I'm pretty stoked that Indeed was a gold sponsor for this PyCon event, and I’m so happy to be part of the Indeed Open Source Software team. It’s a great feeling to help our internal community engage directly with the open source community at events like PyCon. You can see a list of more Python events here: https://www.python.org/community/workshops/.</p>

<p>Want to contribute to open source other ways? Consider helping out those maintainers who give their time and effort towards fixing issues and consider donating to a Bug Bounty program.</p>
